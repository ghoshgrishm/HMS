# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A backend-driven hospital management system developed during my internship at IIT Kharagpur. The system focuses on automating patient admissions, real-time bed allocation, and medicine database management.

## 📌 Project Overview

The application streamlines hospital operations for the In-Patient Department (IPD) by enabling:
- Automatic allocation of beds based on department and availability
- A searchable medicine inventory with intelligent suggestions
- Doctor and department mapping during admission
- A unified workflow connecting patients, beds, doctors, and discharge planning

## 💡 Key Features

- 🔄 **Automatic Bed Allocation**  
  Allocates beds to patients based on real-time availability and department constraints.

- 🛏️ **Dynamic Bed Status Dashboard**  
  Tracks bed statuses (available, occupied, discharged) in real time.

- 💊 **Medicine Search with Suggestions**  
  Allows partial name queries and suggests relevant medicines.

- 🧾 **End-to-End Patient Admission Flow**  
  Includes patient lookup, condition entry, doctor assignment, and admission confirmation.

- 🔗 **Backend Integration with Database**  
  Developed using PHP, MySQL, and managed via PHPMyAdmin and XAMPP.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL (managed via PHPMyAdmin)  
- **Server:** XAMPP (local server environment)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for forms and UI components)

## 🗃️ Database Schema Highlights

- `patients` – stores patient info  
- `beds` – includes bed status and department linkage  
- `admissions` – records new admissions and predicted discharges  
- `doctors` – linked by department for assignment  
- `medicines` – searchable drug inventory

## 🎓 Internship Context

This project was developed as part of my internship at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur (May–June 2025), under the guidance of Prof. Pabitra Mitra.
